# 🚀 JobHub – Django Job Portal

JobHub is a full-stack job portal built with **Django** that connects **job seekers** with **recruiters**. Recruiters can post and manage jobs, while job seekers can search, apply, save jobs, and track their applications through a clean and responsive interface.

This project was built to practice real-world Django development concepts such as authentication, role-based access control, CRUD operations, file uploads, search & filtering, dashboards, email notifications, and relational database design.
